## Context

```
6: 
7: /// Test chdir system call
8: pub fn test_chdir() -> IntegrationTestResult {
9:     // This is a placeholder test
10:     // In a full implementation, we would:
11:     // 1. Create a test directory
12:     // 2. Call sys_chdir to change to that directory
```

## Recommended next steps
- Confirm the owner and adjust scope estimate\- Add unit/integration tests to cover intended behavior
- Produce a PR that either implements the missing behavior or documents a migration if it's a stub
