## Context

```
20: 
21: /// Test getcwd system call
22: pub fn test_getcwd() -> IntegrationTestResult {
23:     // This is a placeholder test
24:     // In a full implementation, we would:
25:     // 1. Get current working directory
26:     // 2. Verify it matches expected value
```

## Recommended next steps
- Confirm the owner and adjust scope estimate\- Add unit/integration tests to cover intended behavior
- Produce a PR that either implements the missing behavior or documents a migration if it's a stub
