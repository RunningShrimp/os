**File:** `kernel/src/mm/tests/alloc_bench.rs`
**Line:** 155
**Marker:** placeholder
**Suggested Priority:** High
**Suggested Owner Role:** Memory/MM Engineer
**Suggested Estimate (hours):** 32
**Suggested Labels:** `high;placeholder`

## Context

```
152:     layout: Layout,
153:     num_ops: usize,
154: ) -> AllocatorStats {
155:     // This is a placeholder implementation. A real benchmark would need to:
156:     // 1. Measure time accurately
157:     // 2. Track actual allocation performance
158:     
```

## Recommended next steps
- Confirm the owner and adjust scope estimate\- Add unit/integration tests to cover intended behavior
- Produce a PR that either implements the missing behavior or documents a migration if it's a stub
