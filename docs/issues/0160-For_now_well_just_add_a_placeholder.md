## Context

```
240: 
241:         // Test basic synchronization primitives
242:         // This would include tests for Mutex, SpinLock, RwLock, etc.
243:         // For now, we'll just add a placeholder
244: 
245:         result.passed_tests += 1;
246:         result.total_tests += 1;
```

## Recommended next steps
- Confirm the owner and adjust scope estimate\- Add unit/integration tests to cover intended behavior
- Produce a PR that either implements the missing behavior or documents a migration if it's a stub
