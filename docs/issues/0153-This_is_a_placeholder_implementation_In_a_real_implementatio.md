221: /// Set the default NUMA allocation policy
222: pub fn numa_set_default_policy(policy: NumaPolicy) {

## Recommended next steps
- Confirm the owner and adjust scope estimate\- Add unit/integration tests to cover intended behavior
- Produce a PR that either implements the missing behavior or documents a migration if it's a stub
