## Context

```
45: 
46: /// Test stat system call
47: pub fn test_stat() -> IntegrationTestResult {
48:     // This is a placeholder test
49:     // In a full implementation, we would:
50:     // 1. Create a test file
51:     // 2. Call sys_stat
```

## Recommended next steps
- Confirm the owner and adjust scope estimate\- Add unit/integration tests to cover intended behavior
- Produce a PR that either implements the missing behavior or documents a migration if it's a stub
