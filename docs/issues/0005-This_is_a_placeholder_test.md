## Context

```
32: 
33: /// Test link system call
34: pub fn test_link() -> IntegrationTestResult {
35:     // This is a placeholder test
36:     // In a full implementation, we would:
37:     // 1. Create a test file
38:     // 2. Create a hard link to it
```

## Recommended next steps
- Confirm the owner and adjust scope estimate\- Add unit/integration tests to cover intended behavior
- Produce a PR that either implements the missing behavior or documents a migration if it's a stub
