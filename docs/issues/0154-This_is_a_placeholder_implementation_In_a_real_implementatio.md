## Context

```
226: 
227: /// Get the default NUMA allocation policy
228: pub fn numa_get_default_policy() -> NumaPolicy {
229:     // This is a placeholder implementation. In a real implementation, we

## Recommended next steps
- Confirm the owner and adjust scope estimate\- Add unit/integration tests to cover intended behavior
- Produce a PR that either implements the missing behavior or documents a migration if it's a stub
