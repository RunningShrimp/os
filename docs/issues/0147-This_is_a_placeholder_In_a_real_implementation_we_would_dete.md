**Marker:** placeholder
**Suggested Priority:** High
**Suggested Owner Role:** Memory/MM Engineer
**Suggested Estimate (hours):** 32
**Suggested Labels:** `high;placeholder`

## Context

```
167: 
168: /// Initialize the NUMA controller
169: pub fn numa_init() {
170:     // This is a placeholder. In a real implementation, we would detect
171:     // NUMA nodes from hardware information.
172:     
173:     // For now, we'll assume a single NUMA node with all CPUs
```

## Recommended next steps
- Confirm the owner and adjust scope estimate\- Add unit/integration tests to cover intended behavior
- Produce a PR that either implements the missing behavior or documents a migration if it's a stub
