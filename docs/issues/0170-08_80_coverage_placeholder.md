**File:** `kernel/src/fuzz_testing.rs`
**Line:** 386
**Marker:** placeholder
**Suggested Priority:** Low
**Suggested Owner Role:** QA/Tester
**Suggested Estimate (hours):** 8
**Suggested Labels:** `low;placeholder`

## Context

```
383:     fn calculate_coverage(&self, syscall: &SyscallSpec) -> f32 {
384:         // Simplified coverage calculation
385:         // In a real implementation, this would use actual coverage data
386:         0.8 // 80% coverage placeholder
387:     }
388: 
389:     fn get_memory_usage(&self) -> usize {
```

## Recommended next steps
- Confirm the owner and adjust scope estimate\- Add unit/integration tests to cover intended behavior
- Produce a PR that either implements the missing behavior or documents a migration if it's a stub
